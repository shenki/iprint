iprint

This package was debianized by Paul Russell prussell@alderaan.franken.de on
Mon,  8 Oct 2001 18:00:19 +1000.

In 2002 Mattias Wadman <mattias.wadman@galaxen.se> added support for printing
binary, and rewrote a majority of the program in doing so.

Since Aug 2005, was maintained by Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>.

It was downloaded using rsync from samba.org::cvs/junkcode/i.c,v.

In 2008 it was sadly removed from the Debian archive. See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=900620

In 2024 Joel Stanley <joel@jms.id.au> created this repository using the history
from Tridge's junkcode directory on github, the Debian package retrieved from
archive.debian.org, and the Debian bug tracker.
